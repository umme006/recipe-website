            <img src="images/chocolate cake.jpg" alt="Chocolate Cake">
            <p>Ingredients:1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
                <br>1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar
                <br>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
                <br>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
                <br>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
                <br>1 teaspoon salt
                <br>2 large eggs
                <br>1 cup whole milk
                <br>1/2 cup vegetable oil
                <br>2 teaspoons vanilla extract
                <br>1 cup boiling water</p>
                            <p>Instructions:Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.
                Mix the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
                Add the wet ingredients: Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla to the flour mixture. Beat on medium speed until well combined.
                Stir in the boiling water: The batter will be thin, but that’s okay!
                Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.
                Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
                Cool the cakes in the pans for about 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans to cool completely on wire racks.</p>
                            <p>Optional Chocolate Frosting:1/2 cup butter (1 stick), softened
                <br>2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
                <br>3 cups powdered sugar
                <br>1/3 cup whole milk
                <br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                <br>Beat the butter and cocoa powder together until smooth.
                <br>Gradually add the powdered sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency.
                <br>Stir in the vanilla.
                <br>Frost the cake once it’s completely cooled.</p>
