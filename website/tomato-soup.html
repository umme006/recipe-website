            <img src="images/tomato soup.jpg" alt="Tomato Soup">
            <p>Ingredients:2 tablespoons olive oil
                <br>1 large onion, chopped
                <br>2 cloves garlic, minced
                <br>800g (2 cans) of whole peeled tomatoes
                <br>2 cups vegetable broth
                <br>1 teaspoon sugar (optional)
                <br>Salt and pepper to taste
                <br>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)
                <br>1/2 cup heavy cream or milk (optional, for a creamier soup)</p>
                            <p>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
                Add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
                Add the tomatoes (including the juice), vegetable broth, and sugar (if using). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes.
                Use an immersion blender or transfer the soup to a regular blender in batches and blend until smooth. Be carefulâ€”it's hot!
                Return the soup to the pot and season with salt and pepper to taste. If you want it creamier, stir in the heavy cream or milk.
                Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil leaves if desired.</p>
