            <img src="images/grilled chicken.jpg" alt="grilled chicken">
            <p>Ingredients:4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
                <br>1/4 cup olive oil
                <br>1/4 cup lemon juice
                <br>3 cloves garlic, minced
                <br>1 teaspoon dried oregano
                <br>1 teaspoon dried thyme
                <br>Salt and pepper to taste</p>
                            <p>Instructions:Prepare the marinade: In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper.
                Marinate the chicken: Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring it’s well-coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, up to 4 hours.
                Preheat the grill: Get your grill nice and hot. You want it around medium-high heat.
                Grill the chicken: Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess drip off. Grill the chicken breasts for about 6-7 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F).
                Rest and serve: Let the grilled chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing or serving. This helps keep the juices locked in.</p>
